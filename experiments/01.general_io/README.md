# Basic GPIO handling example

This code demostrates how to access the various hardware IO by:
1. Colour cycling the RGB LED
2. Falshing the on board LEDs
3. Responding to the Joystick
4. Switching GPIO27 of the Raspberry Pi header on and off at a slow rate to demostrate writing to the RPi header
5.
